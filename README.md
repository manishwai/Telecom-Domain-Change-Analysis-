![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/385bc698-48de-4eeb-9901-181cda01d0a3)

Plan 8, 9, and 10 have been discontinued and Plan 11, 12 and 13 have been introduced after 5G. We have observed that Plan 4, 5, 6, and 7 have experienced a declined revenue growth. So, we need to focus more on these plans along with the newly introduced plans to attract more active users. 
Apart from that, we could introduce modified attractive plans and roll out offers to increase the engagement for Patna, Coimbatore, Chandigarh, Gurgaon, and Raipur as these are the bottom 5 cities in terms of revenue generation.
